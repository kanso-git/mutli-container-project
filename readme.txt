We have added a new nginx folde inside the client folder
check each Dockerfile per folder

For DB usage we will rely on  AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)

How to allow connection trough conatiners and EC and RDS  instaces we have created for this project

 > the Application multi-docker has been created in a specific region of thw world (MultiDocker-env.eba-fkjnhwww.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com )


 VPC = Virtual Private Cloud - please to remember there is one 'default' VPC per region.
 
 We can get our different services to connect to each other by creating something called a security group. 
 A security group is a really fancy term for a Firewall rule, it's a rule discribing
 what different sources of Internet traffic can connect to different services running inside of your VPC.

 In order to connect our EB new application with RDS (Postgres) and EC (Redis) we need to create a new 
 security group.

 The security group is going to say essentially as a rule lat any traffic access this instance 
 if it belongs to the security group.

 So we are going to create a security group and then we are going to attach it to it all three of these different services 
 [multi-docker, postgres and redis]
